# Tutorial: Crank your first kernel

## Introduction

Cranking an Ubuntu kernel is the process of applying updates to an existing Ubuntu kernel, packaging it, and preparing it for testing. [cranky](https://kernel.ubuntu.com/gitea/kernel/kteam-tools/src/branch/master/cranky) is a toolchain which assists in all of these steps.

<!-- TODO specify the SRU cycle -->
In this tutorial, we will crank a 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat) (codename `noble`) Google cloud kernel (codename `linux-gke`). Keep these codenames in mind for future commands.

## 1. Set Up/Update Environment

First, follow the [Cranky Environment Setup] tutorial.

### 1.1. Update chroot environment
We use [chroot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot) environments to isolate different sets of tools when kernel cranking. cranky helps us set up and manage these chroot jails.

If it's our first time creating a chroot for this release (Noble Numbat), we must first create the chroot base:
```bash
cranky chroot create-base noble:linux-gke
```
This will output a lot of text as it installs various packages needed for the chroot to work properly. (It took ~20 minutes to complete.)

Next, create the chroot session:
```bash
cranky chroot create-session noble:linux-gke
```

This will also output a lot of text as it uses apt to install various packages needed for the crank. (It took ~2 minutes to complete.)

<!-- TODO can we be more specific about what each command does? Why are they separate if the descriptions are basically identical? -->

### 1.2. Update kteam-tools
Finally, update your local clone of kteam-tools to the latest commit on the main branch:
For the scope of this tutorial, we will use a particular version of cranky. Run the following commands to get it:

:::{WARNING}
If your kteam-tools tree isn't clean, be sure to save your work before running the commands. 
They will modify the repository!
Git should warn you if any destructive actions might occur.
:::

```bash
cd ~/canonical/kteam-tools/
git pull
git checkout cranky-tutorial
```
<!--TODO checkout a `cranky-tutorial` git tag instead to ensure it's the same-->

After `checkout`, you should see output similar similar to this:

:::{terminal}
    :input: git checkout cranky-tutorial
    :dir: ~/canonical/kteam-tools/
    :user: user
    :host: host
Note: switching to 'cranky-tutorial'.

...

HEAD is now at de4674e4 mainline-build/cod-update-virgin: Split script and update freedesktop repos
:::

## 2. Download Current Version of the Kernel
Next, clone the chosen kernel in its current state.

<!-- TODO is the cd required? Or does cranky checkout default to this dir? -->
<!-- TODO this probably needs SRU cycles specified so it's more reproducible. -->
```bash
cd ~/canonical/kernel/ubuntu/
cranky checkout noble:linux-gke
```

Once this command is finished (It took ~20 minutes to complete), you should see the following directories inside the newly-created `./noble/linux-gke/` directory:
- `linux-main/`: The actual Linux kernel source
- `linux-meta/` <!-- TODO describe --> 
- `linux-signed/`: Canonical's kernel signing stuff <!-- TODO describe better --> 


## 3. Apply Updates from the Upstream Kernel 
The upstream kernel will have changes that should be propagated down to this kernel.

### 3.1. Fix helper scripts
Update the local (in-tree) helper scripts cranky uses to the latest version:
```bash
cd ~/canonical/kernel/ubuntu/noble/linux-gke/linux-main/
cranky fix
```
You should see some output showing that cranky executed several scripts.


### 3.2. Rebase on top of updated parent
Because this is a derivative kernel, we need to apply updates from its parent, the generic kernel:

```bash
cranky rebase
```

:::{tip}
For non-derivative kernels (e.g., `noble:linux`), this step is not required, and doesn't do anything.
:::

### 3.3. Fix helper scripts (again)
Sometimes after a `cranky rebase`, the helper scripts get updated. It's good practice to always re-run:

```bash
cranky fix
```

<!-- TODO what should this section be called? -->
## 4. TODO new section
### 4.1. Starting commit

<!-- TODO this section doesn't really explain why we are doing these things. Learn what's going on and then document better. -->

Run the following command:

```bash
cranky open
```

This command creates a commit which signifies the start of a new release. It updates `debian.gke/changelog` to reflect this.
Optionally, it may also update ABI versioning info. <!--TODO remove if extraneous-->

<!-- TODO what are ABI files? Link to more info somewhere appropriate. -->


Run `git show` and see that this new commit starts with "UBUNTU: Start new release" and shows an update to `./debian.gke/changelog`.


### 4.2. Review 
Sometimes the rebase doesn't get all the changes. Run this command to manually review any outstanding changes:
```bash
cranky review-master-changes
```
This command will output any outstanding changes in a list with their commit hashes and descriptions. Use `git show <commit-hash>` to view the changes.

Usually these can be ignored, but there are a few instances where further investigation is necessary:

- Commits with changes to `debian.master/rules.d/`
    - Choose if these changes should be reflected in `debian.gke/rules.d/`
- Commits with descriptions starting with "UBUNTU: \[Config\]: ..."
    - These indicate a change in the parent kernel's configuration.
    - You'll need to compare this change with what appears in the derivative config (`debian.gke/`) to decide if it should be applied to this crank.

### 4.3. Link to the Launchpad Bug Tracker

Run the following command to link this kernel to its corresponding Launchpad bug tracker:
<!-- TODO "what" are we linking? This kernel? This crank? This repo? What's the proper word to use? -->

:::{caution}
Use `--dry-run` unless you are actually cranking a kernel. Otherwise, this will overwrite Launchpad and might make destructive changes!
:::

```bash
cranky link-tb --dry-run
```

This updates the Launchpad tracking bug, which, among other things, will be used as an input for subsequent steps.

<!-- TODO when is the earliest/latest this step can be done? Is this ordering the most sensible? -->

This will create a git commit. Run `git show` to see it. It should look something like this:

```gitdiff

Then, click the `BugLink` URL to see the relevant Launchpad tracking bug. 
A comment should appear on there that says something like:
```

    + noble/linux-gke: 6.8.0-1017.21 -proposed tracker 
```

If you see similar results, you've successfully linked to the tracking bug.

### 4.4. Update DKMS Packages

`debian.master/dkms-versions` specifies dkms modules to be packaged with its kernel. <!-- TODO does this sentence make sense in the context of the next sentence? -->

This command updates the package versions in `debian.gke/dkms-versions` to match the ones expected for the SRU cycle

```bash
cranky update-dkms-versions
```

No changes are needed this time, so you'll see this output:
```
debian.gke/dkms-versions: No changes from kernel-versions
```

In most cases there would be no change committed as the up-to-date versions should have been committed on the master kernel and picked-up by the derivative or backport on rebase. However, if there is any change, check that the version numbers only become higher and nothing gets dropped completely. In case anything looks suspicious, donâ€™t hesitate to ask the team if the changes are expected.


### 4.5. Closing commit
This step creates one final commit before a release is prepared. Run:
```bash
cranky close
```
This command is a shortcut for several steps:

1. Verifies there are no changes left. <!-- TODO elaborate? -->
2. Inserts changes from the parent kernel into the changelog.
3. Inserts git changes into the changelog.
4. Updates the release series, author and date on the changelog, thus closing the changelog.
5. Creates a commit signifying the finished crank.

If the output went well, you should see a new commit when you run `git show`:
```gitdiff

## 5. Verify the Kernel Builds Successfully
At this point, the kernel is built and packaged. We should test that it builds successfully.
<!-- TODO verify above statement! -->
### Cloud Builder 
<!-- TODO WARNING: cbd is internal only (?) What should we put here instead? -->

Connect to the canonical VPN. Then, run:
<!-- Add to prerequisites: VPN set up! -->

<!-- TODO add git remote add cbd -->


```bash
git push cbd
```

<!-- TODO describe output -->
<!-- TODO describe ssh -->

<!-- TODO ask others about alternatives to CBD/kathleen. Those are for canonicalers only. Is it possible/easy to test in a way that anyone can do? -->

## 6. Package the kernel for Release
Run the following command:
<!--TODO add note that it's "dependents", not "dependent". -->
```bash
cranky update-dependents
```

### 6.1. Tag commit
```bash
cranky tags
```
<!-- TODO describe output -->

### 6.2. Verify Preparation
```bash
cranky verify-release-ready
```

The `tag pushed: warning` is an expected warning if you do not have commit rights.

### 6.3. Pull sources

```bash
cd ..
# CWD == ~/canonical/kernel/noble/linux-gke/

cranky pull-sources noble:linux-gke --latest
```

### 6.4. Build Sources
```bash
cd linux-main/
cranky build-sources
```

## 7. Review
```bash
cd ..
# CWD == ~/canonical/kernel/noble/linux-gke/
cranky review *.changes
```

## 8. Upload

<!-- TODO take note of SRU cycle earlier in the process -->

Normally, at this point a cranker with upload rights would publish the newly-cranked kernel to its PPA, which automatically kicks off boot testing.
However, without upload rights, we can request someone with rights to review our work, and publish the kernel on our behalf.

We can push the created files to a server that is accessible to the reviewer, like `kathleen`.
<!-- TODO is this canonical-only? -->

```bash
cd linux-main/
cranky push-review -s 2024.10.08 kathleen
```
